# Introduction

In order for us to be successful in CTF events, we need to make a concerted effort to participate.

# Rationale

Team Captains are leaders who create something greater than the sum of its parts. CTFs are excellent practice and training for those who want to succeed in the Computer Security field. By electing a Team Captain for CTFs, we are boldly deciding that we want to be a competitive and successful CTF team.

# Responsibilities

* Register and participate in at least one CTF per month.
* Encourage members to participate
* Go through a CTF write-up at least once every two months
* Organize Pi-PWN

# Additional Notes

I think that the position should have a budget, allowing for snacks, etc. and should also schedule CTFs to be not just at school.

# Appointed or elected?

Not sure
