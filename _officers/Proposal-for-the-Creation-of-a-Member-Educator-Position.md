# Introduction

Due to the complicated nature of computer security and the fact that there are few traditional teaching resources on the subject, I propose that a Member Educator position should be added to our roster.

# Rationale

Member Educators are used by a wide variety of organizations. Due to the nature of the RSO structure, we are likely to have members and potential members coming in at disparate times. The function of the Member Educator will be to assist those members and potential members into getting up to speed with the basic techniques and jargon to successfully participate in DATDA events.

# Responsibilities

* Determine the basic knowledge each member should have in order to contribute to events and presentations effectively (This does not mean that a member must possess this knowledge to be a member, but rather it will provide a reference point for members to see what point they are at as far as learning.)
* Once a month interactive presentation designed to help develop the basic skills of members
* Maintain a repository of links, books, etc. to help members attain the aforementioned basic level of knowledge

# Appointed or elected?

I think either works
