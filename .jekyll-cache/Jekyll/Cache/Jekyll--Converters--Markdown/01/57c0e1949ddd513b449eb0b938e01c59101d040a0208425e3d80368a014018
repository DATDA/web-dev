I"Ž<p>Here lies the manual of how DATDA lives and dies. Contained in such are the explicit duties of the officers, the necessary duties of the faithful, and the projects that keep us alive.</p>

<p>It is split into three (3) sections:</p>

<h2 id="officer-duties">Officer Duties</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Things that are explicitly required of the officers as ordained by the constitution and how they get done.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="presidential-duties">Presidential Duties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To preside over most general meetings.</li>
  <li>Call special meetings when necessary.</li>
  <li>To appoint committees.</li>
  <li>To appoint a temporary officer in the instance that a current officer is temporarily or permanently unable to fulfill their duties until an election can be held; given the successive positions to the one being filled have abdicated or are unable to abdicate their succession.</li>
  <li>To make minor decisions regarding the day-to-day operations of DATDA.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vice-presidential-duties">Vice Presidential Duties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To perform all duties of the President in their absence.</li>
  <li>To serve as a chairperson on most committees.</li>
  <li>To oversee all election procedures of the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="secretarial-duties">Secretarial Duties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To keep an accurate record of most organization meetings and activities.
    <ul>
      <li>For this just add posts to the Github-pages site. Theyâ€™re just templates so just copy the previous one and put in your content. Also post this to the #Announcements channel in the Discord so everyone can see/reference easily.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To take charge of all group-wide correspondence.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mailing List:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Send out an email every week before the meetings to the mailing list. Include useful information like what topics the meeting will likely cover and how to unsubscribe. Also send out mailings for any important events. Sending them through the Engineering mailing list (through Dr. Barrot) or through the COSC mailing list (through the COSC secretary) is a great way to build awareness for bigger events (CTFs, PiPwn, Speakers, etc.).</li>
          <li>To get powerz to the mailing list talk to Ward and tell him youâ€™re the new secretary.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Discord:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Discord is the primary means the club communicates so youâ€™re responsible for it. You should be made an admin and after that itâ€™s pretty straightforward. If you want to re-organize or something go for it. If itâ€™ll make a big impact on the club itâ€™s always nice to ask the club first.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Twitterz:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>We have and maintain a twitter account. It doesnâ€™t seem to be very popular but the more you post the more useful it will be. Itâ€™s setup to follow lots of interesting people/companies/orgs in the Cyberz so it shouldnâ€™t be too hard if youâ€™re just looking to retweet things others have posted for our followers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Emailz:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>We have a club email account, datda.uwyo@gmail.com you will be given creds and can use this to sign-up for other sites/services that the club uses.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="treasurer-duties">Treasurer Duties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To keep an accurate and complete record of all monetary transactions.</li>
  <li>Disperse acquired fund money in accordance with regulations of the University of Wyoming.</li>

<h2 id="necessary-duties">Necessary Duties</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Things that are required for DATDA to function in a reasonable fashion but not required by the constitution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="website-admin">Website Admin</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Currently we operate our website out of this here Github!</li>
  <li>The site is a Github Pages site (FREE) with a custom domain.</li>
  <li>All the code is in the DATDA/datda.github.io repository and itâ€™s currently using the Jekyll(sp?) theme to support a more blog-like environment.</li>
  <li>The custom domain is datda.tk which is registered with my.freenom.com and is FREE!</li>
  <li>We also use CLoudflare.com (FREE) to manage DNS and provide for better site-protection (masking emails, ddos, etc).</li>
  <li>Because we â€˜ownâ€™ our own domain (datda.tk) we have the option to use custom domain emails, however current research reveals no decent FREE options for this.</li>
  <li>Due to this our current option for email involves a Gmail account (FREE) â€˜datda.uwyo@gmail.comâ€™ that forwards all email to club officers whom can respond in kind.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chat-server-admin">Chat-Server Admin</h3>
