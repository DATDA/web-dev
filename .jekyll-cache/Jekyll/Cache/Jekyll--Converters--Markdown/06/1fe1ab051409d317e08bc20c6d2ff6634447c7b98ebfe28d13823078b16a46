<h1 id="tomorrows-ctfs">Tomorrowâ€™s CTFs</h1>
<p>The three CTFs start tomorrow and run through the weekend.</p>

<p>STEM CTF â€“ Starts @ 1PM â€“ 24 Hours â€“ Individual Reg, 5 Person Limit*<br />
CSAW Quals â€“ Starts @ 2PM â€“ 48 Hours â€“ Team Reg<br />
EKOPARTY â€“ Starts @ 6PM â€“ 36 Hours â€“ Team Reg<br /></p>

<p>Weâ€™re shooting to meet in the community lab (EN4086) at 5:00PM, but I will probably be in there for most of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Feel free to swing by or leave whenever, thereâ€™s absolutely no commitment. You can ask in the #ctf channel if youâ€™re not sure weâ€™re still there.</p>

<p>*Since the STEM CTF starts early and runs short, weâ€™ll just do first-come-first-serve on team members, regardless of skill. Just tell me if you want on the team.</p>

<h1 id="unearthed-hackathon">Unearthed Hackathon</h1>
<p>Website: https://unearthed.solutions/hackathons/unearthed-denver-2017/</p>

<p>Our chapter of ACM are trying to get groups together to take part in a hackathon in Denver. I went to their meeting and got the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The event takes place over the weekend of September 22-24 (NEXT weekend).</li>
  <li>Registration is free, and food is provided.</li>
  <li>Transportation should be covered.</li>
  <li>Lodging may or may not be covered.</li>
  <li>Information on challenges will be released sometime on Monday the 18th (timezones are hard), but we cannot start working until the hackathon.</li>
  <li>We plan to leave Friday afternoon around 1-2 and arrive at 4. Registration starts at 5.</li>
  <li>The event ends at 7PM on Sunday.</li>
  <li>Including myself, there were three people at the meeting who definitely wanted to attend, and two maybes.</li>
  <li>Depending on the number of people who end up going, we may form one team or two. If we get enough, we could have our own DATDA team.</li>
  <li>We plan to meet next Thursday the 21st to hash out more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re interested, you should probably email Stephen Belden: sbelden@uwyo.edu
He can put you on a mailing list to keep you updated and answer any questions you may have much better than I.(edited)</p>
