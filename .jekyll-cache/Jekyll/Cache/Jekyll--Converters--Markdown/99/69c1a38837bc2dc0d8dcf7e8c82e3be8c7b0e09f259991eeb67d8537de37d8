<p>This page lists the different cybersecurity competitions that we are a part of, and how to participate with us!</p>

<p>What is a cybersecurity competition? Usually, there are two different types, ‚ÄúJeopardy‚Äù and ‚ÄúAttack and Defense‚Äù. With jeopardy style competitions, you are given a series of challenges which are usually arranged in different categories (much like regular jeopardy). You‚Äôll try to answer each of these questions within the time frame of the competition and are awarded a position at the end! Attack and Defense competitions are a little more stressful, exciting, and fun but usually require more practical skills. You are given a (usually) virtual network environment that contains a few machines that you are in charge of. Then you have a little bit of time to secure your machines before the other teams or attackers are allowed to connect to your network. Once this happens then all hell breaks loose, you have to attack the other team‚Äôs machines while maintaining the security of your own and kicking out any intruders who manage to break in. These types of competitions are incredibly exciting and a lot of fun, but do require a little bit different skill set than the jeopardy style.</p>
