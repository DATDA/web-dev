<p>Thanks to all of our wonderful sponsers on patreon and from previous fundraising activities, we were able to give away $140 worth of humble bundles, $123 worth of microcontrollers and development boards for giving away as prizes for CTF competitions, and we paid for $259 dollars worth of food to fuel our mania during capture the flag meetups.</p>

<p>Speaking of our meetups! We met 14 times during our regularly scheduled meeting time in the fancy new CEDAR lab. Then we met up on the weekend 7 times on the weekends to participate in any of the 8 different capture the flag competitions over the semester. Out of those 8 different competitions our club members ranked above the 90th percentile about 2/3 of the time.</p>

<p>We still have a couple of CTF competitions to compete in before the end of the year but we wanted to say thanks to everyone who has made this possible.</p>
