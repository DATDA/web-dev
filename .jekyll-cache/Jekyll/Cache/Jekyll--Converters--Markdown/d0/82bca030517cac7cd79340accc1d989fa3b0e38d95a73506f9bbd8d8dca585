<h2 id="we-did-it">We Did It!</h2>
<p>Howdy everyone,<br />
Weâ€™ve made a ton of changes in the past couple weeks, and I hope youâ€™re just as excited to see them as weâ€™ve been making them happen.</p>

<h3 id="first-this-website">First: This Website!</h3>
<p>If you didnâ€™t notice weâ€™re now using a new CMS to host this blog in a way that should transfer over to our new hosting provider (UW-COSC) much nicer than Drupal.</p>

<h3 id="second-discord">Second: Discord!</h3>
<p>Weâ€™re moving 100% of our chat over to Discord (link at the top) and erasing our Mattermost server next weekend. This means we wonâ€™t have to manage or host it, which should make many things easier.</p>

<h3 id="third-the-playground">Third: The Playground!</h3>
<p>Weâ€™ve had a TON of progress, and it looks like we should be able to allow members access to the playground in the comming months. Weâ€™ll keep you posted on this!</p>

<p>Hack safe,<br />
