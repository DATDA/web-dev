<p>Whatâ€™s a CTF?</p>

<ul>
  <li>A CTF is a series of cyber-security puzzles that are solved to earn points (and maybe cool prizes too)!</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™ll be hosting the competition online, so you can participate from the Union, home, your dorm, or anywhere!</p>

<p>Want to learn more about us? Then come join us Tuesdays at 7pm in EN4066, starting September 5th!</p>
