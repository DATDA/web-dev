<p>You may be asking yourself the following question: “Where the hell do I start?”.
We all have been there, trust us. What we want to do here is to give you some basic starting points that will hopefully begin your torrid forays into the Dark Arts. Fret no longer my friend because here we have created a (semi)comprehensive guide to the l33t skillz you need to tackle the perilous world of cybersecurity!
Hackers are often described as the electronic handyman, the “jack of all trades, master of none”
of the techno world. This is very true in the fact that vulnerabilities and attacks can come
from any number of a bajillion different directions so knowing a little bit about a lot of
stuff can and a lot about a few things can get you very far in this field.
Also, there is definitely no need to be a master in ALL fields of cybersecurity, in the
workforce you will find yourself part of a team of very talented individuals who are very
talented in a few areas but lacking in others. Hopefully those ‘others’ areas are filled by
either you or some of your other teammates so that, combined, your teams knowledge encompasses
the entire spectrum of the field so that you may effectively combat cybercrime.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, I prezent to you a list of topics/walkthroughs to get your feet wet.</p>

<p id="before"></p>

<h2 id="things-to-know-before">Things to Know Before</h2>

<p>You are about to get started learning about computer security which comes with it the inherent fact that many parts of it are dangerous. Since the best way to learn about anything computers is using computers, the fact that you are learning about the dangers parts of computers while using one means there is the possibility of being exposed to these dangers yourself. Below we have compiled a (again, somewhat) comprehensive steps and precautions that you should beware of before entering this field. Please be careful and remember, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons">Sic Hunt Leones</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GET AN ANTIVIRUS!</strong> This should always be step one, and one of the simplest and easiest to protect yourself from ~85% of all bad things. Paid programs can sometimes be the better option because A) the product is the product and not you. B) You are providing financial resources for the experts to continue being experts. But there are also free options such as ClamAV among others. So setup an antivirus, use it, dont bring it down for anything.</li>
  <li><strong>SETUP YOUR FIREWALL!</strong> These can prevent baddies from ever getting inside your computer from the internetz.</li>
  <li>Get familiar with <strong>sandboxing and file checking tools</strong>. Virtual machines are usually the go to for opening risky files but have been known to be exploitable(i.e. the baddie breaks free from the VM and runs loose on your actual machine). VirtualBox and VMWare are the two most common. Dont open risky PDF, MS Office, or zip files on you own machine without scanning them, your antivirus will help with this. For exploring ZIP files, get familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/wiki/quick-start-guide">binwalk</a> program on linux, this will tell you exactly what is inside of a file(i.e. ZIP), as there may be some bad script hidden and set to execute when you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">unzip the folder</a>.</li>
  <li>Buy yourself a <strong>VPN subscription</strong>. You’ll be looking up a lot of stuff that has performed illegal activities before you knew about it, but why should you let others know your looking that up? A VPN will keep your activities fairly anonymous on the internet as well as providing an extra layer of encryption for you. With any sort of free VPN, you will be the product and that company will sell your internet history elsewhere, so fork up the bitcorn and pay.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>javascript and tracking blockers</strong> in your web browser. These will prevent Google Analytics from triggering and recording a visit to the site, as well as any other malicious javascript that might execute. For more tips see our Online Safety talks under the Presentation categories on the <a href="https://github.com/DATDA/main/wiki">wiki page</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Dont blindly click on links</strong>. See where they go first and determine whether or not that is a place that you actually want to go to. Sometimes throughout this site you will see <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBRUQ_30.0.0/com.ibm.resilient.doc/install/resilient_install_defangURLs.htm">defanged urls</a> which is the process of slightly altering web links and addresses to prevent an accidental click-through to a malicious location.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> - The operating system that lets you control everything. Learn about the free Operating System that powers almost every backend server and high performance computing clusters.<br />

<p><strong>Setup Kali</strong><br />
To start learning some more Linux as well as begin exploring a common system for security, you should setup a Kali Linux system of some sorts. You can download the images from <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">here</a>. In order to use this wonderful hacking OS you will eventually need to install it. Here is a list of tutorials that will cover that (since I am to lazy to type one up ;-P).</p>

<h2 id="home-network">Home Network</h2>

<p>The best way to practice these skills is by actually setting up and configuring machines on a network. Researchers at Idaho National Labs recommended that if you do not have your own somewhat advanced home network then you should begin doing that right away. Visit the pawn shop or WillGoodz for some cheap hardware(switches, routers, small cheap desktops, etc.) and build up. Below are some resources for guidance on how to setup your own home laboratory for doing security research:</p>
