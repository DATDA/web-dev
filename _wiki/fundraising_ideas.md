This grand list encompasses all past, present, and future ideas related to fundraising so we (hopefully) stop forgetting good ideas and repeating bad ones.

| Idea | Outcome | Worthwhile | Status | Est. Returns | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Bake Sale|Success|Yes|Present|$50-100/mo|Bread is the most cost-effective by far. Needs more marketing to be more effective.|
|Restaurant Fundraising|Present| Yes |Present|15% of every meal|For SP19 we used Niko Sushi through GroupRaise|
|Podcast|-|-|Future|$0-100/mo|There appeared interest in doing one and it appears reasonable|
|GoFundMe|Failure|No|Past|$15|We tried this as another way donors could fund us for DEF CON, however we didn't really use it|
|Patreon|Pending|-|Present|$1-20/mo|Still in the process of setting it up|
|Merch Runs|Success|No|Past|$5-20|We did this for T-shirts and mugs but had a low margin and didn't sell many|
|Merch Store|Pending|-|Present|$1-100/mo|Just set-up, no real data yet. Using spreadshirt.com so no investment just pure profit.|
|LES (Athletics Security)|Success|No|Past|$7/hr|Not a big enough effort/reward opportunity|
|Safe-Ride|Success|No|Past|$20?/night|We made basically nothing for our work|
|You Fund|-|-|Future|???|Haven't tried it yet. Assumed it would work like GoFundMe|
|Badges|-|-|Future|$10-1000|Was some interest a while ago but none lately. The consensus was that we should focus on big badges (like the DEF CON badges).|
|Membership Dues|-|-|Future|$5-100/yr|Has been proposed many times and strongly rejected many times|
|Lockpicks|-|-|Future|$1-100/yr|Many conflicting ideas about liability and legality and where we would find a long-term market.|
|Silent Auction|Failure|No|Past|-$???|We did an auction hosted by a fraternity and gave several computers worth several hundred dollars and returned with like $20|
|DATDA IT|Success|Probably?|Present|$5/mo|Although recently not very popular we generally make a bit of money on this in the long-term|
|Big Donors|Success|Yes|Present|$?,????|UWEFE/GreenHouse Data/ASUW/CEDAR/COSC/Handel IT/Trihydro/UL Labs/Made Safe in Wyoming/ISSA?|
