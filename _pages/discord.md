The club uses Discord as our primary means of communication.

To join the server, accept [this invite](https://discord.gg/CTzmcVf).

Once you have been added to the server, post a message in the "member-request" chat (which will be the only chat you can see) with your name and asking to be added to the server. You will soon be given member permissions to view and interact with the rest of the server.
