This page lists the different cybersecurity competitions that we are a part of, and how to participate with us!

What is a cybersecurity competition? Usually, there are two different types, "Jeopardy" and "Attack and Defense". With jeopardy style competitions, you are given a series of challenges which are usually arranged in different categories (much like regular jeopardy). You'll try to answer each of these questions within the time frame of the competition and are awarded a position at the end! Attack and Defense competitions are a little more stressful, exciting, and fun but usually require more practical skills. You are given a (usually) virtual network environment that contains a few machines that you are in charge of. Then you have a little bit of time to secure your machines before the other teams or attackers are allowed to connect to your network. Once this happens then all hell breaks loose, you have to attack the other team's machines while maintaining the security of your own and kicking out any intruders who manage to break in. These types of competitions are incredibly exciting and a lot of fun, but do require a little bit different skill set than the jeopardy style.

## CTFTime

Most of the competitions we do are tracked through ctftime.org and you can find our team [link here](https://ctftime.org/team/34010). If you would like to participate with us in these competitions then consider joining our team through this website so we can add to the clubs history.

## National Cyber League

The [NCL Competition](https://nationalcyberleague.org/) is hosted by Cyberskyline and is put on once every semester. The director of the CEDAR lab is often more than generous with supplying us with registration codes for this competition. If you are interested then contact someone in CEDAR and they'll get you hooked up with some codes.

## DOE Cyberforce Competition

An [Attack and Defense competition](https://cyberforcecompetition.com/) that is held once a year at the beginning of November by the Department of Energy. There is a limited size for this team and is usually managed through CEDAR so talk to someone there and express your interest!

## National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition

The [NCCDC](https://www.nationalccdc.org/) is a competition that was popular with the cybersecurity RSO before us (CDAL) but we are still putting teams together for it so come ask us!
