# Meeting Notes Febuary 07th, 2019:

## Hackin with Hydra -> @bugg 
- @bugg talked about the network brute-forcing tool Hydra and how to brute-foce ssh and HTML FORMS authentication

## Updates from the Closet -> @bugg 
- The servers are still down for the vSAN migration
- We got a donation of HDD Caddies from Mike (Thanks!) which is powering the vSAN
- Also got a donation of Lappytops for more hands-on-hacking
- We did a survey and while most people want more hands-on-hacking most were also unwilling to get the VPN setup (thus the need for a good vpn solution integrating the lappytops). 
- Still working on the aformentioned solution ^^^

## Discussion
- We talked about the Bitcoin Exachange owner 'dying' with an encrypted lappytop holding the seeds to $220 Million Dollars (in Bitcoin)
- Other discussions were had
