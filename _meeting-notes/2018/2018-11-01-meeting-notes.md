## DEF CON Funding Proposal -> @bugg
- Proposal boiled down to:
  - Hard deadline of in/out + funded by mid-spring semester
  - Funding deadline means whatever isn't raised through work/donations is self-funded with option for refunds after for post-deadline work/donations.
  - Group funding gets split as decided by group, was generally suggested to be equally split.
- Agreement was made that we should use the proposed funding model
- Fundraising officer agreed to take-on the duty of determining funding quotas based on preliminary logistics with a deadline-ish of early next semester.
