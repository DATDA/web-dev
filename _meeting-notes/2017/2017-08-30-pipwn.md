What's a CTF?

- A CTF is a series of cyber-security puzzles that are solved to earn points (and maybe cool prizes too)!

We'll be hosting the competition online, so you can participate from the Union, home, your dorm, or anywhere!

Want to learn more about us? Then come join us Tuesdays at 7pm in EN4066, starting September 5th!
